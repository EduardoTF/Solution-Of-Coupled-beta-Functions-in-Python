# Solution of the coupled beta functions of the Standard Model and its minimal supersymmetric extension

Here lies a Python code (named beta_functions.py) that solved the coupled beta function (at two loops) of the Standard Model (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM). This solutions is obtained using an adaptative Runge-Kutta method known as the Dormand-Prince method.

The code also contain the solutions of the decoupled beta functions at one loop and their respective coupling constants. In addition, the code plot the values of the coupling constants both SM and MSSM at one and two loops, plot the comparison between the coupling constants of SM at one and two loops, of MSSM at one and two loops, and the comparison between SM and MSSM at two loops.
