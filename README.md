# Solution of the coupled beta functions of the Standard Model and its minimal supersymmetric extension

In this repository there is a Python code (named beta_functions.py) that solves the coupled beta function at two loops of the Standard Model (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM), neglecting the Yukawa terms. These solutions are obtained using an adaptative Runge-Kutta method known as the Dormand-Prince method.

The code also contains the solutions of the decoupled beta functions at one loop and their respective coupling constants. In addition, the code plots the values of the coupling constants both SM and MSSM at one and two loops, it also plots the comparison between the coupling constants of SM at one and two loops and for the MSSM solution at one and two loops. Finally, it also shows the comparison between SM and MSSM at two loops.
